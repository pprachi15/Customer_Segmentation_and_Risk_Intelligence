### Overview  
This project focuses on understanding customer churn behavior, spend patterns, and engagement across a real world credit card portfolio.  
The goal is to identify which customer groups show the strongest churn signals, where revenue risk is concentrated, and how demographic and behavioral patterns influence overall retention.

This work is part of my 30 Day Applied Business Strategy Challenge, a series where I solve one practical business problem each day through data analysis, product thinking, and visual storytelling.

## Objectives  
* Identify customer groups with the highest churn risk  
* Understand behavioral drivers across engagement, utilization, and spend  
* Quantify revenue at risk for high value segments  
* Support strategic decision making through clear segmentation  
* Translate analytical insights into product and retention actions  

---

## Key Questions  
* Which age groups and income levels show elevated churn?
* How engagement levels relate to utilization behavior?  
* Which clusters form the most concerning risk profiles?  
* How credit and spend behavior align?
* What portion of monthly revenue is exposed to churn?
* Which personas should receive targeted retention strategies?

---

## Data Source  
The dataset consists of anonymized credit card customer records including  
* Demographic fields such as age, gender, education level, income category  
* Relationship and account fields such as tenure month, contact count, inactive months  
* Behavioral fields such as total transaction amount, total transaction count, Q4 to Q1 changes  
* Credit information including credit limit, revolving balance, open to buy amount  
* Churn indicator field

---

## Tools Used  
* Tableau Public  
* Excel for light preprocessing  
* SQL inspired logic for segmentation fields  
* Calculated fields for risk scores, engagement tiers, utilization tiers, personas  

---

## Features of the Dashboard  
The dashboard includes  
* Customer segmentation by age and income  
* Churn rate by age group  
* Churn rate by utilization category  
* Engagement versus utilization behavior clusters  
* Credit limit versus spend scatter  
* Full risk funnel distribution  
* Key performance indicators for total customers, high risk customers, churn rate, and revenue at risk  

---

## Insight Summary  
* Customers aged 40-49 display the highest churn levels  
* Low utilization customers represent the strongest churn driver  
* High utilization but low engagement forms the most critical risk segment  
* Spend behavior remains clustered below $15,000 even for higher credit limits  
* Income below $40,000 combined with age 40-49 forms the densest high risk persona  

---

## PM Perspective  
If I were in the role of a product manager, this analysis would support decisions around  
* Prioritizing interventions for the most vulnerable segments.  
* Refining product experience for mid career customers.  
* Strengthening engagement programs for low utilization groups.  
* Building predictive churn models for early detection.  
* Coordinating marketing and servicing teams around targeted outreach.  
* Evaluating credit exposure strategies for low spend segments.

## 30–60–90 Day Product Plan

### First 30 Days  
Focus on understanding the full customer lifecycle, validating analytical assumptions, and confirming the strongest churn predictors.

Key actions  
* Review behavioral segments with data science and analytics  
* Validate churn patterns with customer success and servicing teams  
* Map the customer journey for the high risk persona  
* Identify friction points across engagement, credit usage, and communication channels  
* Align with marketing on existing retention campaigns  

Expected outcomes  
* Clear definition of the problem  
* Agreement on target customer groups  
* Early confirmation of high value opportunities  

---

### Day 31 to Day 60  
Design targeted interventions, strengthen predictive models, and begin controlled experimentation.

Key actions  
* Build an early warning churn model using engagement, utilization, and inactivity metrics  
* Partner with engineering to define data triggers and alert thresholds  
* Create an engagement lift experiment for low utilization customers  
* Design two to three retention offer bundles for the mid age low income segment  
* Define KPIs for engagement improvement and churn reduction  
* Present the intervention roadmap to leadership  

Expected outcomes  
* A working predictive churn model  
* A clear list of experiments for high risk segments  
* Aligned cross functional plan for deployment  

---

### Day 61 to Day 90  
Focus on implementation, tracking, and iterative improvement.

Key actions  
* Launch pilot programs for engagement nudges and retention offers  
* Integrate churn risk alerts into CRM workflows  
* Evaluate uplift in engagement score, utilization stability, and churn reduction  
* Compare experimental groups to control groups  
* Refine interventions based on measured impact  
* Document results and recommend long term investments  

Expected outcomes  
* Measurable improvements in engagement and churn  
* A validated set of retention strategies  
* A scalable framework for long term customer health management
